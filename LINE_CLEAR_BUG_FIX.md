# Line Clearing Bug Fix - Implementation Summary

## Bug Description
In the 3D Tetris game, when a line was completed, most blocks in the line were properly removed except for blocks from the most recently placed piece that completed the line. This caused the game to malfunction as some blocks remained even after clearing a line.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `clearBlocksByType` function, specifically in how it handled horizontal line clearing:

1. The original code was only clearing blocks that it could find in the `this.board` data structure
2. Blocks from the most recently placed piece might not have been properly registered in `this.board`
3. This resulted in some blocks being visually flashed but not properly cleared from the game state

## Fix Implementation

### 1. Enhanced Horizontal Line Clearing
**Location**: `clearBlocksByType` function, 'horizontal-x' case

**Changes**:
- Added a two-pass approach to clearing blocks:
  1. First pass: Count all existing blocks in the line
  2. Second pass: Force null all positions in the line, regardless of current state
- Ensured proper initialization of board data structure
- Added detailed logging for better debugging

### 2. Enhanced Vertical Line Clearing
**Location**: `clearBlocksByType` function, 'vertical-z' case

**Similar improvements**:
- Two-pass approach for counting and clearing
- Board initialization checks
- Better logging

### 3. Improved Visual Synchronization
**Location**: `clearLinesImmediately` function

**Added**:
- Explicit removal of existing static blocks from the scene before recreation
- Verification step to ensure visual state matches board state
- Additional safety checks

### 4. Enhanced Verification
**Location**: Post-clearing verification section

**Added**:
- Emergency clearing for any remaining blocks in horizontal and vertical lines
- More comprehensive line verification
- Detailed positional logging for any blocks that shouldn't remain

## Results

This fix ensures that:

1. All blocks in completed lines are properly cleared, regardless of when they were placed
2. The game board data structure and visual representation remain in sync
3. The game can continue properly after line clearing operations

The changes are focused on reliability and should not affect game performance significantly.
