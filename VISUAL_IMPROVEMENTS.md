# 3D Tetris - Visual Improvements Summary

## Block Appearance Changes (COMPLETED ✅)

### 1. Removed Transparency from Blocks
**Before**: All Tetris blocks had `transparent: true` and `opacity: 0.9` making them semi-transparent
**After**: All blocks now use `transparent: false` for solid, opaque appearance like traditional Tetris blocks

**Files Modified**:
- `createPieceMesh()` function - Current piece blocks material
- `createStaticBlocks()` function - Placed blocks material

### 2. Enhanced Material Properties for Matte Finish
**Added Properties**:
- `roughness: 0.8` - Makes blocks appear matte instead of shiny
- `metalness: 0.1` - Minimal metallic reflection for natural look
- Kept `emissive: 0x000000` and `emissiveIntensity: 0` for flash effects compatibility

### 3. Completely Removed Glow Effects
**Before**: Each block had an additional larger transparent "glow" mesh around it
**After**: Removed all glow geometry and materials for clean, sharp-edged blocks

**Removed from**:
- Current piece blocks (in `createPieceMesh()`)
- Static placed blocks (in `createStaticBlocks()`)
- Shadow projection blocks

### 4. Updated Shadow System
**Changes**:
- Removed transparent glow effects from shadow projections
- Kept the main shadow blocks but removed secondary glow meshes
- Maintained shadow functionality while improving visual clarity

### 5. Enhanced Grid and Environmental Elements
**Grid Reference Dots**: Removed transparency from floor reference dots for better visibility
**Background Particles**: Removed transparency for more defined particle effects
**Walls**: Increased opacity from 0.3 to 0.6 for better contrast while maintaining subtle transparency

## Visual Result
The blocks now appear:
- ✅ **Solid and opaque** like traditional Tetris blocks
- ✅ **Matte finish** with reduced reflections
- ✅ **Sharp, clean edges** without glow effects
- ✅ **Better contrast** against the background
- ✅ **More defined shadows** without distracting glow
- ✅ **Traditional Tetris aesthetic** while maintaining 3D depth

## Technical Details
- **Material Type**: Continued using `MeshStandardMaterial` for proper lighting
- **Geometry**: Kept `BoxGeometry(0.9, 0.9, 0.9)` for proper spacing between blocks
- **Lighting Compatibility**: All changes maintain compatibility with existing lighting system
- **Performance**: Improved performance by removing extra glow meshes (reduced polygon count)

## Code Locations
1. **Line ~452-460**: `createPieceMesh()` material definition
2. **Line ~1450-1460**: `createStaticBlocks()` material definition  
3. **Line ~470-480**: Removed glow effect from current pieces
4. **Line ~550-560**: Removed glow effect from shadow projection
5. **Line ~300-310**: Updated grid reference dots
6. **Line ~150-160**: Updated particle materials
7. **Line ~250-260**: Enhanced wall opacity

The game now has a clean, traditional Tetris block appearance that matches the reference image while maintaining all existing functionality including gamepad controls, dialog systems, and flash effects for line clearing.
